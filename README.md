# Dog-Cat-Classification-Image---Machine-Learning-Model
Use one of the algorithms in image recognition, CNN , this project is trying to predict whether the picture is a cat or dog

# Introduction
This Model is based on https://medium.com/nybles/create-your-first-image-recognition-classifier-using-cnn-keras-and-tensorflow-backend-6eaab98d14dd. i want to give my thankfulness to Yash Agarwal, who wrote the reference.

Some changes are applied as needed

Installing Package
If you are doing in google collaboration, install list of packages:

!pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1

!pip install numpy pandas

!pip install Keras

# Dataset
For dataset in this project, I used https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/P14-Convolutional-Neural-Networks.zip

# Python Files
I also upload 2 python files:

- train_model.py : scripting for train the model

- model_server.py : serve the model trough simple web server

# Image Example
I put some image to test the prediction : cat.jpg and cat1.jpg and dog.jpg and dog1.jpg

Feel free to modify the code. If you feel there's some bug or better implementation, please contact me. 

I really appreciate your support.

### Thanks ###
